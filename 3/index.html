    <h1> Project 3: Face Morphing </h1>

    <h2> NITYA SRI ADAPALA </h2>
    
    <h2> Introduction </h2>

    <p> In this project, I produce a "morph" animation of my face into my sister's face, compute the mean of a population of faces, extrapolate from the 
      population mean to create a caricature of myself and produce a video / gif of my face throughout the years from the ages of six to twenty-four.</p>

    <h2> Part 1. Defining Correspondences  </h2>
    <hr class="rounded">

    <p> First, I found an image of myself and an image of my sister. I resized and cropped it so that our faces were more aligned with each other. In order 
        to morph my face into my sister's face, I first defined pairs of corresponding points on the two images by hand. I found that by increasing
        the number of key points, the morph becomes smoother. To do this, I used the labelling tool provided by a previous student: https://cal-cs180.github.io/fa23/hw/proj3/tool.html
        to ensure that there is a consistent labeling of the two faces. I used the same ordering of keypoints in the two faces as well. I then exported the 
        correspondences into a json file and read them into my jupyter notebook when I needed them. Then, I averaged the two sets of correspondences 
        (one for each image) to get the correspondences for the midway shape to reduce the likelihood of any potential triangle deformations. Using the
        points for the midway shape, I calculated the Delaunay triangulation, which is the optimal choice as it does not produce incredibly skinny triangles. 
        Below, I have shown the Delaunay triangulation overlaying each image: </p>
