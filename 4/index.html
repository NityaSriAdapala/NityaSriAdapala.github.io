    <h1> Project 4: Image Warping and Mosaicing </h1>

    <h2> NITYA SRI ADAPALA </h2>
    
    <h2> Introduction </h2>

    <p> In this project, I take two or three photographs and create an image mosaic by registering, projective warping, resampling, and compositing them. 
        Throughout this project, I learned how to compute homographies, and use them to warp images.</p>

    <h2> Part A </h2>

    <h3> Taking Images </h3>
    <hr class="rounded">

    <p> Below are some images I used in this project: </p>
  
    <hr class="rounded">
    <h3> Recover Homographies </h3>
    <hr class="rounded">

    <p> First, using the online tool provided by the course, I identified correspondence points in each pair of images, where one image is 
        the image that will be warped onto the reference image and the second image is the reference image. After setting up the overdetermined 
        linear system of equations, we solve it using least squares. After performing SVD, we get the matrices U, S and V transpose. In order 
        to minimize the loss function we want the vector that corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue in V transpose, which is the last vector.
        We then reshape the vector into a 3x3 matrix. This becomes our H matrix.</p>

    <hr class="rounded">
    <h3> Warp the Images </h3>
    <hr class="rounded">

    <p> Now that we have calculated the homography matrix, we can use this homography to warp each image towards the reference image. 
        First, I find the corners of the image to identify the boundaries of the bounding box before warping. Then, I do a forward warp 
        of the bounding box and normalize it so that I know the space in which pixels need to be filled. I then find the bounding box of 
        the final image which is an empty canvas. I copy over image 2 into the final image. Once I've found the polygon in which the final
        image will be placed, I applied inverse homography to perform a backward warp to produce the final output coordinates. Finally, 
        I interpolated the pixels in image 1 that will be mapped to each pixel in the output. Below are the resulting images: </p>

    <hr class="rounded">
    <h3> Image Rectification </h3>
    <hr class="rounded">

    <p> To ensure that my homography and warping is working correctly, I performed image rectification. I took pictures of things that 
        I knew were square at an angle so that they weren't square in the image. I then rectified the images by warping the images so
        that the features become square. First, I selected four points in the original image that would map to a square, which I defined manually,
        and then I compute the H matrix using these correspondence points. Using this H matrix, we warp the image so that the features become square.
        The black areas of the image are caused due to the distortion of perspective. Here are the images before and after rectification: </p>
